## Project Overview

**Little Lemon Chicago** is a responsive web application that serves as the online interface for a fictional Mediterranean restaurant. The goal of this project was to build an engaging and intuitive user interface for customers to learn more about the restaurant and make reservations.

This project was bootstrapped using **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds, along with **React** for its component-based architecture.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Reservation System**: Users can easily make table reservations with an interactive form.
- **Single Page Application (SPA)**: Smooth navigation between different sections without page reloads.
- **Fast Load Time**: Built using Vite, ensuring minimal load times and optimized performance.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: Component-based JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **Vite**: Next-generation frontend tooling for faster development and build times.
- **React Router**: For handling client-side routing and smooth navigation.
- **Form Handling**: With built-in validation for reservation form submissions.
